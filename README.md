With the recent rise in Sensors use, the wireless sensor technology is on a rise.
The recent advancements help us to use the technology in many different fields
as it has become more reliable and cheap.This project falls into the domain of Smart Office. We
aim to use the appliances efficiently by monitoring the population of the room.
The Sensors continuously monitor the temperature, population and light intensity
for efficient use of electricity. The locking System can be used for Security
purpose. The buzzer rings continuously to indicate the intruder entry. However
we cannot ignore the manual controls of it. So, we designed a user friendly UI in
processing to manually control the appliances.
